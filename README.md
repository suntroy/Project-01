There are 33 knots (34 including the time function) from lines 33 to 378
There are many decisions that can be made that influence your story. You can choose to speak or stay silent, and determine which path you'd like to take in the chasm. Picking up an item opens other endings.
There is a time loop used to indicate the progression of days if you linger in the cavern for too long. (lines 367-378)
There is a pickaxe that is able to be picked up that unlocks two new endings (line 264)
There are Boolean variables that are used to determine whether it's your first time visiting a room (lines 26-30). If it is your first time, your guide will give instructions on where to go. Otherwise, you must ask them again for the instructions. I kept the descriptions since they are essential for helping remember what room you are in. 

I expect to get a 19/20 for the things I have included.
